# Password-Generator

For this project I have made a functioning password generator using javascript.
Upon opening the web page you are greeted with a prompt asking the specified length of a password between 8 and 128 characters long.
After inputing specified length you are asked if you would like to use uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters in your password.
if you dont have at least 1 type of character chosen it will come up with an alert telling you that you need at least 1 type of character for it to work.
after meeting requirements the generator will take your specifications and generate a randomized password for you.
